Now that We have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over two weeks, We will have the opportunity to be as creative as We want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of our choice or to come up with a 
problem that We can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

## 1) Introduction/Business Problem
This project will be an opportunity to see what is the best city for living according to the next preferences: a movie theater, food, dog parks. If there is a chance to move out to these cities: New York and Toronto, this project will help.

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data

To perform this analysis, we will need the following data:

Geo-coordinates of New Yokr and Toronto.
Geo-coordinates of districts will be obtained with the help of the geocoder tool in the notebook.
Top venues data will be obtained from Foursquare through an API.
