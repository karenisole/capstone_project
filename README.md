Now that We have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over two weeks, We will have the opportunity to be as creative as We want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of our choice or to come up with a 
problem that We can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

## 1) Introduction/Business Problem
I want to use this opportunity to see how alike is San Antonio to Mexico City. I have a new job, and it is located there. So if there is any possibility for me to change locations, I want to be prepared to move there. 

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data

Just to know more about San Antonio, I am going to use Foursquare to compare both locations.
