Now that We have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over two weeks, We will have the opportunity to be as creative as We want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of our choice or to come up with a problem that We can use the Foursquare location data to solve.
## 1)Introduction/Business Problem
This project will be an opportunity to see what is the best city for living according to the next preferences: a movie theater, food, dog parks. If there is a chance to move out to these cities: New York and Toronto, this project will help.
## 2)Downloading and Prepping Data
To perform this analysis, we will need the following data:
Geo-coordinates of New York and Toronto. Also, I would obtain Geo-coordinates of districts with the help of the geocoder tool in the notebook. Finally, I would consider top venues data from Foursquare through an API.

## 3) Methodology

For this case, I used a list of Toronto's zip codes, including the boroughs and neighborhood names, to locate the Top venues. 

**_Toronto_ **

The geographical coordinate of Toronto, Canada, are 43.6534817, -79.3839347.
Toronto has ten boroughs and 103 neighborhoods.
Review East York. Because my friend lives there.
The geographical coordinate of East York are 43.699971000000005, -79.33251996261595.

Explore East York neighborhood in Toronto with Foursquare API
The top Venues 
Neighborhood 1st Most Common Venue  \
0  East Toronto, Broadview North (Old East York)          Intersection   
1                                        Leaside           Coffee Shop   
2                Parkview Hill, Woodbine Gardens           Pizza Place   
3                               Thorncliffe Park     Indian Restaurant   
4                               Woodbine Heights    Athletics & Sports   

Analyzing this venue, I think that if I am going to live in Toronto with one of my best friends in cluster number 2. There are more venues and also a Mexican Restaurant! I love it
**_New York_ **

## 4) Results

Toronto Top Venues

New York Venues

Although I would love living in New York for the diversity and variety of things. I would say that the best option to be living in Toronto and New York are:
Toronto

New York
The geographical coordinate of New York City are 40.7127281, -74.0060152.
The geographical coordinate of Brooklyn are 40.6501038, -73.9495823.
Latitude and longitude values of East Flatbush are 40.64171776668961, -73.93610256185836.
Found 2112 venues in 70 neighborhoods.
I prefer to live in cluster number 1 or 4.

## 5) Discussion
I could say that I had to change the top venue of Toronto and New York because Toronto does not have many things to do compared to New York. 


## 6) Conclusion

**_This report may help someone planning living in Toronto or New York by comparing the current offers and neighborhood profiles. However, it may not cover all variables such as access to public transportation or even the cost of living so it shall not be used as a single decision-making tool._**
