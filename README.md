Now that We have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over two weeks, We will have the opportunity to be as creative as We want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of our choice or to come up with a 
problem that We can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

## 1) Introduction/Business Problem
I have taken my first steps towards acquiring skills related to data science by doing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course on Coursera. The last module of this course is a capstone project. I want to use this opportunity to looking for a neighborhood in San Antonio close to my preferences. I have a new job, and it is located there. So if there is any possibility for me to change locations, I want to be prepared to move there. 

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data

To perform this analysis, we will need the following data:

Geo-coordinates of the districts in San Antonio Tx
Top venues of districts

Geo-coordinates of districts will be obtained with the help of the geocoder tool in the notebook.
Top venues data will be obtained from Foursquare through an API.
